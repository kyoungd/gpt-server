        "Thank you for calling accident specialist. My name is Evelyn. How can I help you?",
        "I got into a car accident and I need some help.",
        "OK.  We can help.  Can you tell me what happened?",
        "I was driving home from work yesterday when a car ran a red light and crashed into the driver's side of my car. I was in shock and my first instinct was to call 911. The other driver seemed to be fine, but I was having trouble catching my breath and my chest was in a lot of pain. The paramedics arrived quickly and took me to the hospital, where I was treated for a concussion and a few broken ribs. I'm feeling a little better today, but I'm still in a lot of pain and I'm not sure when I'll be able to go back to work. I'm also worried about the damage to my car and how I'm going to pay for it. I had two passengers, and they also suffered pain.  They were treated by paramedics on the scene.  Can you please advise me on what to do next?",
        "I hope you are able to make a full and speedy recovery. Take care of yourself and don't hesitate to reach out for support if you need it.",
        "I'm going to ask you a few more questions to start your claim process.  Are you the driver of the vehicle that was hit?",
        "Yes, I am.",
        "Can you tell me your name and phone number please?",
        "My name is John Doe and my phone number is 123-456-7890."
